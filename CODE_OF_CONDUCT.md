# CodenamePHP Code of Conduct

## Introduction, Purpose and a simple fallback rule (One to rule them all!)
CodenamePHP ist a tiny org. In fact, it's just me. It's where I do my
"recreational coding" or building stuff I intent to use in my day job when
I don't want to have any time or budget constraints.

Since I value my (at times very limited) spare time the primary purpose
of this code of conduct is very simple and probably very different from
most other code of conducts: It is to cut arguments short in order to
keep what's left of my sanity intact and to keep things the way I like them.
Therefore, the first and - more importantly - final arbiter is: me.

If I say the earth is flat then - within this org - it is. If anyone can't
live with that I'm sure there's a lot of other orgs and projects out there
that are a better fit. (The earth is NOT flat btw - don't get any funny 
ideas!)

Having said all that: I do like to think that my idea of a "civilized 
interaction with each other" is rather reasonable and that most people can
agree with.

## Org Standards

This is lifted from the `Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct` and while I think
it's a good start, I will add some more clarification on what my interpretation
of these examples are below:

> Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
> include:
> 
> * Using welcoming and inclusive language
> * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
> * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
> * Focusing on what is best for the community
> * Showing empathy towards other community members
> 
> Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
> 
> * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
> advances
> * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
> * Public or private harassment
> * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
> address, without explicit permission
> * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
>  professional setting

While this all sounds nice it is (probably intentionally) rather vague. But
it kind of boils down to my favorite rules for life:

### Don't be a dick

Plain. Simple. Still really vague. In fact, everyone has their own interpretation
of what this means. But luckily at this point I can just point at the introduction 
above. When in doubt if what you are about to say or do falls under that rule,
chances are: it does! If you still go through with it and the doubt remains then
I will resolve that doubt - one way or the other.

To try and get the vagueness out of that I will list some specific examples that
probably everyone knows who spent some time around forums or "comment sections".

### Sexism/Racism/"Political Correctness"
First of I really dislike the term "political correctness". "Political correctness" 
sounds like it is removed from our everyday life and just something that applies to others.
When I grew up we called it "having good manners". Or once again: "don't be dick". 

I guess from this alone you can guess my stance on this and for a long time I used to think
this is just "normal" and not something you have to point out. But especially in recent
years I learned that reality disagrees with me. So:

I have really no idea how this comes up that often, especially in software projects
whre none of those have ANYTHING to do with the code that was written, let me just
spell it out as clear as I can

If you think it's a good idea to attack a person or their code because of their
* sex/gender/identity/<insert other category here I probably don't even heard of)
* skin color/ethnicity/nationality
* religious belief (or lack thereof)
* physical or cognitive disability
* anything else that relates to "protected classes" or has nothing to do with the code and/or
facts at hand
this is most likely not the place for you. Feel free to find out but don't be suprised if my
patience on these issues is rather short.

### Humor
Everything said above also applies to "humor". While I enjoy really dark and "edgy" humor
myself, one has to be aware that others might not. This is especially tricky when you 
can only see what someone worte. Plus the person reading it will most likely don't know
you and doesn't even know it's meatn as a joke and even if so, they might not find it
funny. Therefore you should play it safe and when in doubt ... well, see above. Also:
We don't have time for jokes anyway, we are here for serious business! (This was a joke ...
or was it? I'm german after all you can never know ... see what I mean?)
